    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `amqprs = "^0.10"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 2.1.3, 2.1.2, 2.1.1, ...
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `material-workers v0.1.0 (D:\tiktok clone\be\material-workers)`
if you are looking for the prerelease package it needs to be specified explicitly
    amqprs = { version = "1.1.0-rc.2" }
